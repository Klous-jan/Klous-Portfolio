# Portfolio Website v0.9.000+

Welcome to my portfolio website which is currently still in development. Below I will list the current state and restrictions of **v0.9.000** and what is to come in **v1.0.000**. This is primarily a way for me to set my goals, track things I want to fix or modify, and overall document the development of my portfolio!

## v0.9.000 current restrictions

-   Currently not functional on mobile.
-   Some page scaling needs tweaking.
-   Need to test portfolios responsiveness on multiple browsers.

## v0.9.000 to-do list:

-   Resolve the 'current restrictions' section.

-   Need to add more of my completed projects to the 'My Work' section.
-   Tweak some styling and animations.
-   Add flip card animation to project cards to display the projects concept and the skills, languages, and libraries used in that project.

## v1.0.000 expectations:

-   Full mobile compatibility.
-   Pages scaling and responding 100% as intended.
-   Portfolio QA tests completed on multiple browsers.
-   Additional styling added from to-do list.
-   Completed projects added to site and responding as intended.
